<p>I’m a web designer/developer hybrid. I’ve been working on the web since 1998. The majority of both my professional and hobby experience has been as a solo designer/developer. I love design and programming equally and, throughout my career, I've tried to sharpen my abilities in both. I choose projects that give me experience in as many aspects of web site and web app creation as possible. That typically means I'm working on projects where there's either not a need or not an ability to hire a team.</p>

<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>

<p>This playbook is inspired largely by the <a href="http://playbook.thoughtbot.com/">thoughtbot playbook</a>. If you haven't read it, you should check it out. thoughtbot uses their playbook to document best practices and help their team understand how they run the company and how they build products.</p>

<p>You may be wondering why I'd want to write my own playbook. After all, since I'm a <em>solo</em> designer/developer, I don't have teammates I need to share institutional knowledge with. Here's what is motivating me to build my own playbook:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Most of my work is done alone. I rarely have a need to defend, or even verbalize, my process, toolset, or philosophy. Writing down the details makes concrete what is often merely intuitive.</li>

  <li>Documenting my process should help me find weaks spots and holes. Already, as I've been thinking over the various components of my work, I've found things that need to change.</li>

  <li>As an independent contractor, I have no supervisor pushing me to a higher standard of professionalism. That's not my client's responsibility, it's my responsibility. Owning up to my way of working pushes me to better it.</li>

  <li>I've learned so much from the web design community over the years. I hope this playbook can benefit other solo designer/developers out there.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="guiding_principles">Guiding Principles</h2>

<p>These principles guide me in finding and doing my work.</p>

<h3 id="choose_fitting_roles">Choose Fitting Roles</h3>

<p>Choosing to be a generalist doesn't mean, because you work cross-functionally, that any and all roles will be a good fit. There are valid reasons for specialization and you'll never be able to compete with specialists.</p>

<p>Many projects won't benefit from a designer/developer hybrid. Often, the larger the team or project, the more specialization is needed and the less a generalist is useful. Choose companies or projects that will benefit from a generalist. This is likely to be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Small businesses and organizations</li>
  <li>Early-stage startups</li>
  <li>Niche web products</li>
  <li>Companies with fluctuating needs or staff</li>
</ul>

<p>Another option is to look for design shops that need "some development" or dev shops that need "some design." But this can be a tricky situtation. On the one hand, you may get to work under some great specialists (designers in design shops, developers in dev shops), but the organization is not likely going to value the other discipline to the same degree. They're biased to see their specialty as superior and the other disciplines as supports to the "primary" work.</p>

<p>Look for places that will value someone who can "wear multiple hats." This leads right to the next principle.</p>

<h3 id="take_responsibility">Take Responsibility</h3>

<p>The defining characteristic of the specialist is that there are things they "don't do." Developers "don't do" design. Designers "don't do" copy. Copywriters "don't do" systems administration. Therefore, the advantage of the generalist over the specialist is that they will do whatever needs to be done. <em>This is your key value proposition.</em> Business owners need someone who can be fully responsible.</p>

<p>Make yourself invaluable to your employer or client by taking responsibility. I mean that in two ways.<p>

<p>First, take full responsibility for the areas you are already expected to perform well in. These are the things that are seen and obvious to those who pay you. Do the job you were hired to do, and if you fail, take ownership and then take steps to remedy the situation.</p>

<p>Second, acquire adjacent areas of responsibility that are unoccupied or poorly occupied. These are things that are often not seen and not obvious to those who pay you. No one's organized all the brand's assets? You do it. No one's created a site style guide? You do it. No one's audited the CSS for unused styles? You do it. No one's tracking user signups? You do it. No one's documented rebuilding the server from bare metal? You do it.</p>

<p>Know your client, earn their trust, and then take the initiative to acquire new areas of responsibility. Just stop when you hit someone else's area of responsibility. Or when you're told to.</p>

<p>The more areas of responsibility you have, the more invaluable you are. The more invaluable you are, the harder it is to replace you, and the better your bargaining position for higher pay, greater opportunities, and more flexibility.</p>
